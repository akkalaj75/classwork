Then, it uses a queue to perform a level order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree. In level order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right. The program does this by:

Starting with the root node, it is added to the queue.
While the queue is not empty, the node at the front of the queue is accessed, its value is printed, and then it is removed from the queue.
If the current node has a left child, that child is added to the queue. Similarly, if the current node has a right child, that child is also added to the queue.
This process repeats until the queue is empty, ensuring that all nodes are visited in level order.
The output of this program is the values of the nodes in level order traversal: "1 2 3 4 5".
